    "One important thing to note is that in a \"real world\" scenario, users who accessed a computer before the current suspicious user (according to the timestamps given in access_logs.csv and activity_logs.csv) would likely not be counted. For simplicity, this algorithm tracks all users but could be modified to account for this if we wanted to. We co\n",
    "\n",
    "To put this in terms of code, analyze_compromise initializes with a deque containing the starting user and empty sets to track visited nodes. While the queue is not empty, we remove and process the next user in line. For each user, we query the activity logs to find all computers they've accessed. For each of these computers, we then query the access logs to find all other users who accessed that computer. Any newly discovered users are added to the queue for processing, ensuring we traverse the entire connected network.\n",
